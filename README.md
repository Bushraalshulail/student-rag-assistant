#  Student RAG Assistant

An Arabic-friendly student assistant chatbot that uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** powered by **Google Gemini** and built on **[n8n](https://n8n.io)**.

This system automatically retrieves relevant PDF files from **Google Drive**, extracts the content, and feeds it along with the studentâ€™s question into a powerful AI model to generate accurate educational answers.

---

## Project Overview

This project enables students to ask questions through a simple chatbot interface. The backend workflow will:

1. Search for educational PDFs in Google Drive
2. Download the matched file
3. Extract text from the PDF
4. Pass the question + extracted text to Gemini
5. Generate a smart answer
6. Send the response back to the frontend

All steps are automated using a visual workflow in n8n.

##  What is RAG?

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** combines:

- **Retrieval** of knowledge from trusted sources (PDFs, documents, etc.)
- **Generation** using an AI model like Gemini to create a relevant response

This method boosts accuracy and reduces hallucination compared to pure generative models.
